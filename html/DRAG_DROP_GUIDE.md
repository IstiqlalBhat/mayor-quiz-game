# 🎮 Drag-and-Drop System Guide

## ✅ Phase 2.3 Complete: Drag-and-Drop Mechanics

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### **1. Enhanced Drag Handlers**
- ✅ Building data stored in drag transfer
- ✅ Custom ghost image during drag
- ✅ Visual opacity reduction on original card
- ✅ Tracking of currently dragged building

### **2. Drop Validation**
- ✅ Check if cell is empty
- ✅ Check if player has sufficient funds
- ✅ Visual feedback for valid/invalid drops
- ✅ Prevent drops on occupied cells

### **3. Successful Drop Actions**
- ✅ Deduct cost from city funds
- ✅ Place building in grid
- ✅ Update stats based on building effects
- ✅ Animate building appearance (pop animation)
- ✅ Show celebration sparkles

### **4. Visual Feedback**
- ✅ Valid drop: Green pulsing border
- ✅ Invalid drop: Red background with shake
- ✅ Toast notifications for errors
- ✅ Celebration particles on success

### **5. Error Handling**
- ✅ Toast: "Not enough funds!"
- ✅ Toast: "Spot already occupied!"
- ✅ Console logging for debugging

## 🏗️ How It Works

### **Step 1: Start Dragging**
```javascript
User drags building from palette
  ↓
handleBuildingDragStart() fires
  ↓
- Store building in currentDraggedBuilding
- Add .dragging class (opacity 50%)
- Create ghost image
- Log to console
```

### **Step 2: Drag Over Grid**
```javascript
User drags over grid cells
  ↓
handleGridDragOver() fires continuously
  ↓
Check validation:
  - Is cell empty? ✓
  - Can afford cost? ✓
  ↓
Apply visual state:
  - Valid: .drag-over (green pulse)
  - Invalid: .invalid-drop (red shake)
```

### **Step 3: Drop on Cell**
```javascript
User releases mouse over cell
  ↓
handleGridDrop() fires
  ↓
Double-check validation
  ↓
IF VALID:
  1. Deduct funds: cityFunds -= cost
  2. Apply effects: happiness/funds/interest
  3. Place in grid: cityGrid[index] = building
  4. Show celebration: sparkles burst
  5. Update UI: renderCityGrid() + updateStats()
  6. Toast: "✅ House placed! -$10M"

IF INVALID:
  1. Show red shake animation
  2. Toast error message
  3. No changes to state
```

### **Step 4: End Dragging**
```javascript
handleBuildingDragEnd() fires
  ↓
- Remove .dragging class
- Clear currentDraggedBuilding
- Clean up all .drag-over classes
```

## 📊 Building Effects

### **Effect Mapping:**
```javascript
House    🏠  -$10M  →  Happiness +5
Shop     🏪  -$15M  →  Funds +5
Factory  🏭  -$20M  →  Funds +10, Happiness -5
Park     🌳  -$12M  →  Happiness +8
Office   🏢  -$18M  →  Interest +8
```

### **Net Effect Examples:**
- **Place House**: Cost $10M, Gain Happiness +5 = Net funds -10M
- **Place Shop**: Cost $15M, Gain Funds +5 = Net funds -10M
- **Place Factory**: Cost $20M, Gain Funds +10 = Net funds -10M, Happiness -5

## 🎨 Visual States

### **During Drag:**
| Element | State | Visual |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Palette Card | `.dragging` | 50% opacity + rotate 5deg |
| Valid Cell | `.drag-over` | Green border + pulse |
| Invalid Cell | `.invalid-drop` | Red background + shake |
| Ghost Image | Custom | 80% opacity clone |

### **On Drop Success:**
1. **Grid Cell**: Building icon pops in (scale 0 → 1.2 → 1)
2. **Sparkles**: 8 particles burst outward in circle
3. **Toast**: Green success message slides in
4. **Stats**: Numbers update with transitions
5. **Palette**: Cards re-render (disable if now unaffordable)

### **On Drop Failure:**
1. **Grid Cell**: Red shake animation
2. **Toast**: Red error message slides in
3. **No state changes**

## 🎆 Celebration Effect

### **Sparkle Burst:**
```
        ✨
    ✨      ✨
✨      🏠      ✨
    ✨      ✨
        ✨
```

- 8 sparkles (✨) shoot outward
- Each at 45° intervals (0°, 45°, 90°, etc.)
- Travel 120px in 1 second
- Fade out and scale down
- Golden drop shadow

---

## 🔔 Toast Notifications

### **Types:**
1. **Success** (Green):
   - "✅ House placed! -$10M"
   - Background: Light green gradient
   - Border: Green left bar

2. **Error** (Red):
   - "❌ Not enough funds! Need $15M"
   - "❌ This spot is already occupied!"
   - Background: Light red gradient
   - Border: Red left bar

3. **Info** (Blue) - Not currently used:
   - Future: Tutorial hints, achievements

### **Animation:**
```
Slide in from right → Pause 3s → Slide out
Timing: cubic-bezier bounce effect
Position: Next to building palette (desktop)
```

## 🎮 How to Use

### **Playing the Game:**

1. **Make sure you have funds** (check City Funds stat)
2. **Drag a building card** from the right sidebar
3. **Hover over grid cells**:
   - Green pulse = valid drop
   - Red background = invalid (occupied or too expensive)
4. **Drop the building** on a green cell
5. **Watch the celebration!** ✨
6. **See stats update** automatically
7. **Building palette updates** (disables unaffordable buildings)

### **Strategy Tips:**
- Houses increase happiness (good for balance)
- Shops generate funds (earn back investment)
- Factories generate lots of funds but hurt happiness
- Parks boost happiness significantly
- Offices increase special interest support

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### **Drag Functionality:**
- [ ] Can drag affordable buildings
- [ ] Cannot drag unaffordable buildings
- [ ] Ghost image appears during drag
- [ ] Original card becomes semi-transparent

### **Drop Validation:**
- [ ] Green pulse on valid cells
- [ ] Red shake on occupied cells
- [ ] Red shake when insufficient funds
- [ ] Prevents double-placement

### **Stats Update:**
- [ ] Funds deducted correctly
- [ ] Building effects applied
- [ ] Stat bars animate smoothly
- [ ] Palette re-renders after placement

### **Visual Feedback:**
- [ ] Celebration sparkles appear
- [ ] Success toast shows
- [ ] Error toast shows (try invalid drops)
- [ ] Building icon pops into grid

### **Edge Cases:**
- [ ] Drag and drop on same cell multiple times
- [ ] Try to place when funds = exact cost
- [ ] Try to place when funds = cost - 1
- [ ] Fill entire grid (60 buildings)
- [ ] Drag while timer is running

---

## 🐛 Known Behaviors

### **Expected:**
- Dragging reduces palette card opacity to 50%
- Multiple invalid drop attempts show error each time
- Toast messages queue (don't overlap)
- Grid re-renders on every placement
- Palette re-renders when funds change

### **Not Implemented Yet:**
- Building removal/selling
- Building relocation (drag existing buildings)
- Undo feature
- Adjacency bonuses
- Building upgrades

---

## 📱 Mobile Support

### **Touch Events:**
Currently uses mouse drag-and-drop API.

**For full mobile support, need to add:**
- Touch event handlers (touchstart, touchmove, touchend)
- Long-press for building info
- Haptic feedback (if supported)

**Workaround for testing on mobile:**
- Use Chrome desktop mode
- Or wait for Phase 5.3 (Mobile Optimization)

---

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria Status

- ✅ **Drag works from palette** - Full drag support
- ✅ **Drop validation works** - Checks funds and occupancy
- ✅ **Buildings place correctly** - Grid updates properly
- ✅ **Stats update on placement** - Effects apply immediately
- ✅ **Visual feedback is clear** - Green/red states, animations

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **Immediate:**
1. Test the drag-and-drop in browser
2. Try placing all building types
3. Verify stats update correctly
4. Check affordability logic

### **Future Phases:**
- **Phase 2.4**: Building management (click to remove, drag to move)
- **Phase 3**: Adjacency bonuses
- **Phase 4**: Story integration with buildings
- **Phase 5**: Polish and mobile optimization

---

## 💡 Testing Commands

### **Manual Testing in Console:**

```javascript
// Check current funds
console.log('Funds:', gameState.cityFunds);

// Check grid state
console.log('Grid:', gameState.cityGrid.filter(c => c !== null).length, 'buildings placed');

// Manually place a building (for testing)
const park = buildingPalette.find(b => b.id === 'park');
placeBuilding(25, park);

// Check a specific cell
console.log('Cell 25:', gameState.cityGrid[25]);

// Clear grid (reset)
gameState.cityGrid = Array(60).fill(null);
renderCityGrid();
```
