```
1. House ($10M) → Funds: $40M
2. Park ($12M) → Funds: $28M
3. House next to park ($10M) → Funds: $18M
4. Shop ($15M) → Funds: $3M + $5M effect = $8M

Total spent: $47M
Total gained: $5M
Net: -$42M
Benefits: High happiness, zone formed
```

**Fund Generation Strategy:**
```
1. Shop ($15M) → Funds: $35M + $5M = $40M
2. Shop ($15M) → Funds: $25M + $5M = $30M
3. Shop ($15M) → Funds: $15M + $5M = $20M
   → Shopping District formed! +$8M = $28M
4. Now can afford Factory!

Zone bonus pays dividends!
