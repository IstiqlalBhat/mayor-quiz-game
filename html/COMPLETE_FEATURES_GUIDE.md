## 🎯 Strategic Tips

### **Adjacency Combos:**

#### **Best Combos (Bonuses):**
1. **Park + House** → +2 happiness (house bonus) + +3 happiness (park bonus) = **+5 total!**
2. **Shop + House/Office** → +2 funds per adjacent building
3. **Office + Shop/Park** → +2 interest per adjacent building
4. **House + Park** → Maximum happiness boost

#### **Avoid These (Penalties):**
1. **Factory + House** → -4 happiness (pollution!)
2. **Factory + Park** → -4 happiness (ruins nature!)
3. **Factory isolated** = No penalty

#### **Strategic Placement Patterns:**

**Residential District:**
```
[🌳][🏠][🏠]
[🏠][🌳][🏠]
[🏠][🏠][🌳]
```
Multiple houses around parks = Maximum happiness

**Commercial Zone:**
```
[🏢][🏪][🏢]
[🏪][🌳][🏪]
```
Offices and shops near parks = Great balance

**Industrial Area:**
```
[  ][  ][  ]
[  ][🏭][  ]  ← Isolate factories!
[  ][  ][  ]
```
Keep factories away from houses/parks

## 🎲 Gameplay Examples

### **Example 1: Early Game Strategy**

**Starting State:**
- Funds: $50M
- Happiness: 50
- Grid: Empty

**Turn 1:** Place Park ($12M)
- Funds: $50M - $12M = $38M
- Happiness: 50 + 8 = 58
- No adjacency (alone)

**Turn 2:** Place House next to Park ($10M)
- Funds: $38M - $10M = $28M
- Happiness: 58 + 5 (base) + 2 (park bonus) + 3 (house near park) = **68!**
- 🎉 **Great combo!**

**Turn 3:** Place another House next to first House
- Funds: $28M - $10M = $18M
- Happiness: 68 + 5 + 2 (near park) = **75!**
- 🌟 **Excellent happiness!**

### **Example 2: Economic Focus**

**Place Shop ($15M)**
- Funds: $50M - $15M + $5M (effect) = $40M
- Net cost: $10M

**Place Office near Shop ($18M)**
- Funds: $40M - $18M = $22M
- Interest: +8 (base) + 2 (near shop) = **+10!**

**Place Factory isolated ($20M)**
- Funds: $22M - $20M + $10M (effect) = $12M
- Net cost: $10M
- No penalties (isolated)

## 📊 Statistical Impacts

### **Building Placement Example:**

Adjacency: Happiness -4 per house × 2 = -8
Total Impact: Funds +10, Happiness -13

Net: Great for funds, terrible for happiness!
```

**Place Park surrounded by 4 Houses:**
```
Base Effect: Happiness +8
Park Adjacency: +3 per house × 4 = +12
House Bonuses: +2 per house × 4 = +8
Total Impact: Happiness +28!

This is the BEST strategy! 🌟
