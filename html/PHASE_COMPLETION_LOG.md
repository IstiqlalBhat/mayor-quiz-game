- [x] **Critical State (5-0s)**: Dark red, shake animation, intense effects
- [x] Smooth color transitions between states
- [x] Progressive animation intensity
- [x] Progress bar color changes (green → yellow → red)

- [x] Audio hooks ready for future sound implementation

### Visual Features:
| State | Time | Color | Animation | Special |
|-------|------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Calm | 60-30s | Green | Gentle pulse | Relaxed |

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Next Phase Options:

#### **Option A: Phase 1.3 - Time Bonuses & Scoring**
Add strategic depth to timer:
- Award points for fast decisions
- Time bank system (good choices = +10s)
- Final score includes time bonus
- Achievements for speed

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Impact:** High (adds replayability)

#### **Option B: Phase 2.1 - Building Palette UI**
Start drag-and-drop system:
- Create building palette sidebar
- Display available buildings as cards
- Cost system
- Draggable cards

**Estimated Time:** 45-60 minutes  
**Complexity:** Medium-High  
**Impact:** High (core feature)

#### **Option C: Polish & Test Phase 1**
Refine what we have:
- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile optimization
- Bug fixes
- UX improvements

**Estimated Time:** 20-30 minutes  
**Complexity:** Low  
**Impact:** Medium (quality)

## 💡 Recommendations

### Suggested Path Forward:

1. **Quick Test** (5 min) - Test current implementation in browser
2. **Phase 1.3** (45 min) - Complete timer system with bonuses
3. **Phase 2** (2-3 hours) - Build drag-and-drop system
4. **Phase 3** (1-2 hours) - Adjacency rules
5. **Phase 4+** - Integration & polish

**Reasoning:**
Completing Phase 1.3 gives you a fully-featured timer system before moving to the complex drag-and-drop feature. This creates a natural checkpoint.
