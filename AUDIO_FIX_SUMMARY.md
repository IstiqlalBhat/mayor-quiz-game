# Audio Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. SFX Not Playing
**Problem:** Sound effects were not playing during gameplay.

**Root Cause:** The `playSfx()` method was using `cloneNode()` on Audio elements (line 320), which doesn't work reliably for audio playback in browsers.

**Fix:** Changed to reset and replay the same audio instance using `currentTime = 0` instead of cloning.

```javascript
// Before (broken):
const sfxClone = sfx.cloneNode();
sfxClone.play();

// After (fixed):
sfx.currentTime = 0;
sfx.play();
```

### 2. Gameplay Music Not Playing
**Problem:** Music would not transition from menu music to gameplay music.

**Root Cause:**
- The `playMusic()` and `stopMusic()` methods were not properly handling async operations
- Music tracks could overlap during transitions because fade-out wasn't awaited
- `currentMusic` was being set to null immediately instead of after fade completion

**Fix:**
- Made `playMusic()` and `stopMusic()` async functions
- Added proper await for music transitions
- Added logging to track music state changes
- Reset track position when switching songs

```javascript
// Before:
playMusic(trackName, fadeIn = true) {
    if (this.currentMusic) {
        this.stopMusic(fadeIn); // Not awaited!
    }
    // Play new track immediately (overlaps!)
}

// After:
async playMusic(trackName, fadeIn = true) {
    if (this.currentMusic) {
        await this.stopMusic(fadeIn); // Properly awaited
    }
    track.currentTime = 0; // Reset position
    // Play new track after old one stops
}
```

## Additional Improvements

### Enhanced Logging
Added comprehensive console logging to track audio state:

- **Music state:** Shows when music is disabled, when tracks are playing/stopping
- **SFX playback:** Logs each sound effect played
- **Loading summary:** Shows how many audio files loaded successfully
- **Error handlers:** Catches and logs audio loading errors

### Better Error Handling
- Added error event listeners to all audio elements during preload
- Added try-catch blocks with specific error messages
- Errors now show which specific file failed to load

### Load Tracking
- Counts successfully loaded music tracks and sound effects
- Displays summary 2 seconds after initialization
- Helps identify missing or broken audio files

## Testing

### Using the Debug Tool
A debug tool has been created at `html/audio-debug.html`:

1. Open `html/audio-debug.html` in your browser
2. Check the "Audio Manager Status" section to verify initialization
3. Test individual music tracks and sound effects
4. Check the "Audio Files Check" to see loading status

### Testing in Game
1. Open the game in your browser (http://localhost:8001)
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for these messages:
   - `âœ… Music loaded: [track]` - Music files loaded successfully
   - `âœ… SFX loaded: [effect]` - Sound effects loaded successfully
   - `ðŸŽµ Audio preload summary:` - Summary of loaded files
   - `ðŸŽµ Playing music: [track]` - When music changes
   - `ðŸ”Š Played SFX: [effect]` - When sound effects play

### Common Issues to Check

**If you see "Music disabled" or "Sound disabled" messages:**
- Check the music/sound toggle buttons in the start menu
- Check localStorage: `localStorage.getItem('manestreet_music')` and `localStorage.getItem('manestreet_sound')`
- Toggle the settings in-game to enable them

**If audio files fail to load:**
- Check that audio files exist in `html/audio/music/` and `html/audio/sfx/`
- Verify file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check browser console for HTTP 404 errors
- Ensure you're running from a web server (not file:// protocol)

**If audio doesn't play due to browser policy:**
- Modern browsers block autoplay until user interaction
- The game handles this by starting audio on first click
- If issues persist, click anywhere on the page first

## Files Modified

1. **html/audio-manager.js**
   - Fixed `playSfx()` method (removed cloneNode)
   - Made `playMusic()` and `stopMusic()` async
   - Added comprehensive logging
   - Added error handlers for audio loading
   - Added load tracking and summary

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Menu music plays on start screen
- [ ] Gameplay music plays when game starts
- [ ] Music transitions smoothly (no overlap)
- [ ] Victory/defeat music plays at game end
- [ ] Button click sounds work
- [ ] Building placement sounds work
- [ ] Choice selection sounds work
- [ ] Timer warning sounds work (yellow/red/critical states)
- [ ] Achievement sounds work
- [ ] Zone formation sounds work
- [ ] Music toggle button works
- [ ] Sound toggle button works
- [ ] Settings persist after page reload

## Browser Console Commands

Useful commands to test audio manually:

```javascript
// Check if audioManager exists
typeof audioManager

// Check current settings
audioManager.musicEnabled
audioManager.soundEnabled

// Test playing music
audioManager.playMusic('menu')
audioManager.playMusic('gameplay')

// Test playing sound effects
audioManager.playSfx('buttonClick')
audioManager.playSfx('buildingPlace')
audioManager.playSfx('achievement')

// Check loaded files
Object.keys(audioManager.musicTracks)
Object.keys(audioManager.soundEffects)

// Check loading state
audioManager.musicTracks.menu.readyState // 4 = HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the game thoroughly with audio enabled
2. Verify all sound effects trigger at appropriate times
3. Check that music transitions work smoothly
4. Ensure settings persist correctly
5. Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
6. Test on mobile devices for touch compatibility

## Notes

- All audio files are preloaded for instant playback
- Frequently used sounds use pooling (multiple instances) to allow overlapping
- Music fades in/out smoothly during transitions (2s fade in, 1s fade out)
- Volume levels: Music at 40%, SFX at 60% by default
